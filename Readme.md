# DATABASE WE VERSIONS
Yo fam, this here’s the ultimate repo for your database course grind — built by us, the real ones from Universitas Terbuka’s Information Systems crew. We put together all the essentials you need to master database game: from schema design, slick queries, to dope features like triggers and stored procedures.

This project’s made to help you get a real feel of how databases work, easy to follow, and ready for you to flex and build on however you want. So don’t be shy — dive in, tinker, and level up your skills till you’re bossin’ it.

Massive respect to Shakira, Kiran, Putri, and all the UT crew who held it down and helped make this repo fire. Without you lot, it wouldn’t be half as tight.

> Stay sharp, keep hustlin’, grind hard like a true don, and let’s stack that knowledge and get this bread proper — no shortcuts, all boss moves! Respect to the real ones makin’ moves every day.
